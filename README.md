# Android Full Screen Browser

This is an embarrasingly terrible app for Android devices so I can host up my local server in a full screen browser.

I wrote this one so I can simply side load useless android tablets and turn them into something they are only good for, clocks.

The url is hard coded and it's not in any app store.
